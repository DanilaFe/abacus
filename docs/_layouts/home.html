      <h2>Precision</h2>
      Abacus uses a mathematical tool called Taylor Series to determine values
      as accurate as the user desires. Of course, this comes with some
      performance issues with larger numbers. However, Abacus has been
      tested to generate the value of e correctly to a thousand digits.

      <h2>Configurable and Customizable</h2>
      The very first idea for Abacus was inspired by how difficult it was
      to program a TI-84 calculator. Only two languages were available, TI-BASIC
      and Assembly, the latter having virtually no documentation. Determined
      to be better than a TI-84, Abacus implemented a plugin system that allows
      users to easily create and add plugins written in the same programming
      language as Abacus itself - Java. These plugins can access the full
      power of the language, and implement their own ways of handling numbers,
      as well as their own functions and even operators.<br><br>
      Besides the ability to add plugins, Abacus also adds some general
      options that can be used to make the user's experience more pleasant.
      For instance, it allows for a computation limit to be set in order
      to prevent excessively long evaluation: 8!!! is, for example, an expression
      that even Wolfram Alpha doesn't compute accurately, and will never finish
      on Abacus (it's simply too large). The computation limit will allow Abacus
      to kill a computation if it takes too long. Support for user-definable
      precision is also planned.

      <h2>Built-in Documentation</h2>
      Abacus plugins are given a mechanism to register documentation for
      the functions that they provide. The Abacus GUI displays these
      functions in a searchable list, allowing the user to read the parameters
      that have to be supplied to each function, as well as learn about
      its return value.<br><br>
      The search finds functions not only by their names, but also by relevant
      terms mentioned in the function's description, thus allowing related
      functions to be displayed together.
