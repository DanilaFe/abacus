## So... what IS Abacus?
It's a calculator. Obviously. But what makes it better than
what already exists? There's a few things. Abacus is:
* Programmable, and not in TI Basic.
* Precise. With the "precise" option, Abacus can keep up to 50 significant figures.
* Capable. Ever wonder what 2<sup>700</sup> is? How about 8!!? Abacus can tell you!
* Offline. While Wolfram Alpha can do powerful math, it needs internet connection!
* Built for the desktop. Why use buttons on the screen when there's buttons on the keyboard?
* Open source. Don't like something? Help is always welcome!

## Why was Abacus made?
The initial project was proposed for the [Northwest Advanced Programming Workshop](http://nwapw.org/about/).
You can read the project proposal on the main GitHub page, although the idea has
changed quite a bit, mostly in shifting from "fast" to "precise".

## What is Abacus made with?
Java and Kotlin. Java provides a good layer of abstraction and a great standard
library, while Kotlin allows for the reduction of boilerplate code and null
safety. Using JVM-based languages also allows Abacus to expose its entire
API to plugins, and load them at runtime.
